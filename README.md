## Introduction
In this project, the program will train a machine learning model using data from the 'train.csv' file, which will be used to predict whether passengers survived or not in the 'test.csv' file. The results of the predictions will be saved in a new file called 'result.csv'

## Search Algorithms
This project aims to solve the 'DZ Day' problem using four different search algorithms: BFS, IDS, A*, and weighted A*.

## Genetic EP
The focus of this project is to introduce genetic algorithms.

## Game Simulation
The objective of this project is to apply the `min-max` algorithm to solve the [Sim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_(pencil_game)) pencil game.

## Naive Bayes Classifier
In this project, the goal is to use the Naive Bayes Classifier to analyze news articles from the analytical news website "Asre Iran" and categorize them. The aim is to predict the category of each news article using data available about the description of the news.

## Machine Learning
The objective of this project is to familiarize with machine learning methods and estimate diabetes based on a dataset collected by NIDDK, using the Learn-Scikit library.

## Neural Networks
### Part 1
In this project, we implement forward feed neural networks for image classification.

### Part 2
In this project, we use the Tensorflow library and the Keras interface to implement a feed-forward neural network.
